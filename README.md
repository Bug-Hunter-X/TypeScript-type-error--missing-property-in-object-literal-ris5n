This example demonstrates a common TypeScript error related to type checking of object literals.  The function `printCoord` expects an object with `x` and `y` properties. However, if you were to attempt to pass an object with an additional property, such as 'z', TypeScript will throw an error because the type assertion fails.  The solution involves either modifying the function's type definition to accept the additional property, or filtering out the unwanted property before passing the object.
